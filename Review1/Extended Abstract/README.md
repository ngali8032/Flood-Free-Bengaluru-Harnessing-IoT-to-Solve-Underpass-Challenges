#### **Title:** Flood-Free Bengaluru: Harnessing IoT to Solve Underpass Challenges
#### **Project Supervisor:** Dr. C. Kamalanathan, Associate Professor, Department of Electrical, Electronics and Communication Engineering 
#### **Mini Project (PROJ2999) Outcome: **
#### **‚óè Early prediction of weather, rainfall, and water levels in the underpass**
By predicting rainfall and water stagnant levels in advance, we can deploy resources (like pumps or barricades) to mitigate flooding before it disrupts traffic and affects public health.
Ultrasonic sensor thresholds with a 2 to 5 cm are commonly used
Flood detection Threshold level 1 to 2 cm for early alerts
The pump activation Threshold is 5 to 10 cm to control drainage and free from false alarms.
