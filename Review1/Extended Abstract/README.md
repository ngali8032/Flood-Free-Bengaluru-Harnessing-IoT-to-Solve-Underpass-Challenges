#### **Extended Abstract PROJ3999 (Major Project)**
#### **Title:** Flood-Free Bengaluru: Harnessing IoT to Solve Underpass Challenges
#### **Project Supervisor:** Dr. C. Kamalanathan, Associate Professor, Department of Electrical, Electronics and Communication Engineering 
#### **Mini Project (PROJ2999) Outcome: **
#### **● Early prediction of weather, rainfall, and water levels in the underpass**
By predicting rainfall and water stagnant levels in advance, we can deploy resources (like pumps or barricades) to mitigate flooding before it disrupts traffic and affects public health.
Ultrasonic sensor thresholds with a 2 to 5 cm are commonly used
Flood detection Threshold level 1 to 2 cm for early alerts
The pump activation Threshold is 5 to 10 cm to control drainage and free from false alarms.
#### **●	Real-Time Flood Monitoring and Alerts**
The drained water from flood mitigation systems can be efficiently stored and distributed for various applications like irrigation, public amenities, or sewer systems
a)	Piping System - Water flow through pipes occurs almost instantaneously, with delays only during peak loads or blockages.
b)	Irrigation System - A single cycle for irrigation takes a few hours to cover large fields (1–4 hours).
c)	Public Amenities - Water can be distributed immediately upon activation, with time-varying by demand and distance.
Sewer Systems - Water transfer in sewer systems occurs in real time once operational. Delays might occur during maintenance or high-capacity flows
